      <title>In this edition of InfoContext, we talk with Dr. John Callaghan, an Associate Professor of Political Science at the Graduate School, New England College, the USA, about the challenges the US faces in domestic and foreign policy. The biggest issue that will grow in American politics and dominate throughout the coming year is the election. How russia will try to influence the course of electoral races in the USA, and what kind of information war it will wage - this question remains open. Today, creating and provoking new zones of geopolitical fault lines into cracks, such as Hamas&#39;s attack on Israel, fueling the brewing conflict in South America (Venezuela-Guyana), etc., russia is trying to influence the formation of the agenda of global politics. But its sphere of influence is limited because the US was, is, and will remain a global leader and still has a powerful potential to solve many problems. How to preserve American support for Ukraine and attention to our country in the face of global challenges? We will also discuss Dr. Callaghan&#39;s recent study &quot;The Evolution of U.S. media coverage of the russian Invasion of Ukraine, January to November 2023&quot;.</title>

      <title>How is the European security architecture changing in the era of global changes and upheavals? Is Europe capable of taking more decisive actions to strengthen the security of the entire region, since it is obvious that the world is gradually crystallizing into two camps? The Democratic camp, which we can call the Global West, is the countries of North America and Europe, New Zealand, Oceania, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and several Asian countries. The Anti-democratic camp today is russia, North Korea, Iran, China, and the countries of the Global South. Observing the process of strengthening the Anti-democratic alliance, the United States, as a global leader, understands that the United States needs European allies no less than the European allies need the United States. These and other fundamental questions we are discussing in an interview with Louis Wierenga, a Lecturer at Baltic Defence College, Tartu, Estonia.</title>

      <title>In this edition of InfoContext, you will hear an interview with Roman Horbyk, a Senior Lecturer at Örebro University (Sweden) and Chair of Ukraine Task Force and Mediatization Section at the European Communication Research and Education Association. Is Swedish society vulnerable to russian propaganda? Sweden, as a country that has not known what a real war is for two hundred years, is currently under the umbrella of NATO and has extremely strong bureaucratic inertia, but is slowly starting to wake up from its &quot;lethargic sleep&quot;. The Swedish elites are extremely well aware of all the existing threats of russian propaganda, therefore the study &quot;Transformation of Propaganda&quot; conducted by Roman Horbyk, leading a group of scientists, on the basis of the Södertörn University and with the support of the Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation, is relevant and in high demand by the Swedish state.</title>

Who Dares Shares!” is an observational diary written over the first eighteen months of russia’s war against Ukraine that began in February 2022. Concerned and frustrated by the lack of attention that the world media paid to the build-up of russian troops on the Ukrainian-Belarusian and Ukrainian-russian borders in January 2022 Robin Horsfall began to post critical warnings on social media outlets.
