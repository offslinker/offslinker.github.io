    <title>Міжнародний діалог</title>
    <link>https://ukr.radio/prog.html?id=1047</link>
    <description>Проєкт журналістки Вікторії Крюкової, у якому вона разом з гостем обговорює нагальні питання міжнародної політики, що безпосередньо стосуються України. Ведуча працює з певною темою, чи подією, аналізує її, та за допомогою гостя — спеціаліста у обговорюваному питанні — доносить до слухача її важливість та прояснює роль України у тому, чи іншому міжнародному процесі. Мета проєкту — довести закордонному слухачеві, що Україна — не об&#39;єкт, а повноцінний гравець, який здатен відстоювати свої інтереси та стверджуватися на міжнародній арені.</description>

      <title>This edition of International Dialogue is about the Ukrainian cooperation with the Asian countries and the countries of the BRICS union. We often talk about the countries that helped Ukraine win the war against Russia. At the same time, it is very interesting to understand how the Ukrainian diplomacy should work with those who didn&#39;t voice their support. I am talking about the countries of the BRICS union. BRICS is an intergovernmental organization comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Some countries like Argentina declined the invitation and didn&#39;t join. It is also interesting could China change its position towards Ukraine. Now, the Chinese are still trying to maneuver between Ukraine and Russia.  So, today, I will talk with Alina Hrytsenko, an expert at the National Institute for Strategic Studies. You will hear the first part of our conversation.</title>

      <title>This edition of International Dialogue is about the current Russian involvement into the war between the Israel and Hamas.The war between Palestina and Israel is not news for the world. It has been going on for decades with breaks. Many analysts said that Ukraine has to take an example from that situation, especially Israel, as a country at constant war. Now, the conflict blew up with a new power. Why did it happen now when Ukraine is so close to the winter season, and the USA stopped actively supplying weapons to our country because of the inner disagreements? It looks like the Russian plan has started to work abroad now. So, today I will talk with Iliya Kusa, an international policy expert who can explain the real situation behind the emotional lines of any war.

      <title>You will hear the second part with Rob Feldman. In the second part, we continued to discuss English-language art in Ukraine. We also discussed new qualitative and modern cinema materials like those created in 2019 – «The First Swallows.» These Ukrainian TV series raised a lot of interesting and painful for a lot of teenagers topics like bullying, the absence of parents&#39; attention to teenagers during the hard period of their lives, crushes, and suicide. They also mirrored the American variant called – «13 Reasons Why»? It is a very good example of a modern Ukrainian TV series that mirrors the problematic daily school life. Another topic for discussion was one of the theater adaptations of The Wild Theater, the play «Tom on the Farm.» It raised a topic about the LGBT society in Ukraine. To sum up, the place of creation of the English language&#39;s fictional materials, as theater performances and cinema works, is open. The question is only in the quality of the material and promotion of it in Ukraine and abroad. As a young English-language actress and journalist, I hope we will create it with modern Ukrainian directors sooner or later.</title>

      <title>This edition of International Dialogue is about the importance of creation of English- language performances and cinema works in the times of war. The question of English language culture in Ukraine has just started to rise. Some theaters have been trying to perform in English, although we can&#39;t talk about the wide business format of the creation of English-language products in Ukraine. Few actors know English well and can be good actors simultaneously. Most actors who know English well have been studying abroad or studying it individually. This question is important to raise because we have a solid necessity to tell about the real situation in Ukraine in English, understanding both the Western mentality and the Ukrainian one.  I know only one theater that makes performances in English in a quite good and balanced way, combining it with an acting school -ProEnglish theater of Ukraine.  It won&#39;t be an exaggeration to say that we have a huge bridge between the Ukrainian mindset and the Western one, mostly because of the Soviet past, which didn&#39;t finish for many people in Ukraine. People coming to see English performances are mostly the modern young generation. So, it is approximately from 5 to 10 percent of Ukrainian youth. Today, I will talk with Rob Feldman, who became famous in Ukraine as an actor with a Western education and knowledge of English well.  You will hear the first part of our conversation.</title>

      <title>This is the second part of International Dialogue about transformation policy in Ukraine implemented by young leaders. So, Ukraine needs to reform even during a war, and the EU perspective directly depends on that factor. The political climate in Ukraine has constantly been changing. For many foreigners, it looked weird how fast everything sometimes changes without any discipline and respect for the rule of law. We must admit that most Ukrainians need a proper political education to choose the right leader. Such young politicians as Yuilia Marushevska clearly show that we need a new way of thinking in our old political system, and it starts to work step by step.</title>

      <title>This edition of International Dialogue is about the changes that young Ukrainian public figures want to implement in Ukraine now in times of war. Some people now are saying that it is not correct to talk about politics. And they are quite right because we have a war which is going on in our country. At the same time, we need to realize that exactly the politics brought us to the tragic conflict we have. So, it is necessary to talk about the political environment now in Ukraine to avoid future mistakes and to rethink the past. Yulia Marushevska shot to fame as the star of a viral video during Ukraine&#39;s Euromaidan Revolution. She has since risen to national prominence as a key member of Mikheil Saakashvili&#39;s reformist team in the Odesa.  It all happened like in the past life when we had frozen conflict but not a full-scale war. Now, she is the leader of an advisory board that should become a platform for transformations in the Ministry of Defense. And, in general, she is a public figure who creates a good image of Ukraine inside and outside the country. Today, I will talk with Yulia about the changes she and her team want to implement in Ukraine now in times of war. You will hear the first part of our conversation.</title>

      <title>Clearly the world is changing, and that change has been affecting Eastern Europe for several years now, which means that Central and Eastern Europe geopolitical realities are being transformed also. The region will surely not serve as a bridge between Europe and Russia in the near future, as Russia has decided to burn all such bridges down. Most likely it will act as a fortress, and hopefully not as the battlefield that Kissinger’s submission would suggest. I continue to talk with Jozef Hrabina, a geopolitical advisor and the company&#39;s founder -GeopoLytics.  We discussed new realities for Eastern Europe and how Ukraine can improve our diplomatic relations with Eastern European countries.</title>

      <title>According to international expert Jozef Hrabina, in his book Diplomacy, Henry Kissinger regards Central Europe as an epicentre of major wars on the continent. With Russia’s war in Ukraine and the push for rearmament in the region, Kissinger’s words are becoming a warning for leaders that decades of peace do not make Central Europe a war-free utopia. So, today I will talk with Jozef Hrabina, a former chief analyst at the Council of Slovak Exporters about the role of the Eastern Europe on the international arena. We also discussed the recent political turmoil in the American Congress and how it can influence the military supply to Ukraine. You will hear the first part of our conversation.</title>

      <title>This edition of International Dialogue is about English language media in Ukraine and how they can continue to inform people, keeping the balance of different opinions.  Mu guest was Brian Bonner, the former chief-editor of the Kyiv Post and a legend in English-language journalism in Ukraine. We discussed different media trends in Ukrainian journalism including partisan press and how we as journalists can avoid the pressure from the owner of media. You will hear the second part of our conversation. The war made its corrections in the media sphere in Ukraine. First, the propaganda Russian media lost their influence in Ukraine. Second, the world paid much more attention to our country because of the war horrors they witnessed. So, the necessity of creating qualitative English-language media content in Ukraine is extremely important now. It would be good if the government organizations realized this necessity and gave more financing to this aspect. However, as media workers, we must stay open to discussing the creation process of English-language content in Ukraine.</title>

      <title>This edition of International Dialogue is about English language media in Ukraine and how they can continue to inform people, keeping the balance of different opinions.  In 2018, I wrote a diploma work about English-language media in Ukraine. Mostly, it was connected to KyivPost, the English version of the Day newspaper, and the Ukrainian Week. It was considered an example of the qualitative press in Ukraine, which tells the truth about what is happening in our country. Almost all of them were united in describing Ukraine as a potentially successful country with many political turmoil’s and the biggest problem -corruption. For a deeper understanding, I will specify that the edition split into Kyiv Independent and Kyiv Post two years ago. Today, I will talk with the so-called former chief editor of the Kyiv Post- Brian Bonner, who remains a legend in English-language journalism in Ukraine. You will hear the first part of our conversation.</title>

We also discussed the question of religion in Ukraine, how we can take lessons from history, and the necessity of the world to realize that the war continues in Ukraine. So, in the long run, the Ukrainian political society started to change, which is a sign that society has changed too. We all want the change, and it will come. Maybe even sooner than we think because it is possible to reform the country even in times of war.</title>

      <title>This edition of International Dialogue is about the modern political trends in Ukraine and how did it change recently. In 2019, new parties came to Verkhovna Rada, and new young leaders appeared there. It is very interesting to watch how the leading party, the Servant of the People party, invited a lot of new faces to them. Some of them had no political background, like M. Tyshenko. Still, the President said he believes them and wants to give a chance to people. A new generation of media managers and professionals in different spheres came to power. Sviatoslav Yurash became the youngest MP in Ukraine. He co-founded the cross- party conservative grouping Values. Dignity. Family in the Ukrainian parliament. He also voted against ratification of the Istanbul Convention in Ukraine. Today, we will talk with Sviatoslav about creating a new political culture in Ukraine, war realities, and how we can develop more our international connections with world partners. You will hear the first part of our conversation.</title>

      <title>This edition of International Dialogue is about the USA&#39;s future presidential elections, the election campaign&#39;s start, and how it can influence Ukraine. We talked with Artur Koldomasov, an International Information Analyst at Detector Media. This edition we crossed the line a bit and talked also about the importance of political psychological analyzes of the world leaders. Anyway, for Ukraine, getting financial and military help from the USA is extremely important. It is still hard to say who will win the elections for now. We know that with the help of President&#39;s Biden Administration, we got a huge support for our soldiers. There is no guarantee that Mr. Trump (given he wins the election once more) will continue this line. Anyway, any American leader who understands the necessity of countering Russia should consider this element in the promotion of his election campaign.</title>

      <title>This edition of International Dialogue is about the USA&#39;s future presidential elections, the election campaign&#39;s start, and how it can influence Ukraine. The United States is the undisputed leader in providing aid to Ukraine and mobilizing world support for our country: defense, financial, political, and humanitarian, as well as in ensuring sanctions pressure on the aggressor country. After February 24, 2022, the US Congress allocated $66 billion for Ukraine and other countries for Ukraine-related needs. Of this, $13 billion is direct budget support for Ukraine through non-refundable grants and over $1.9 billion in humanitarian aid. The American presidential campaign has been officially opened. What should one expect from the Candidates and how it can influence Ukraine? We will talk with Artur Koldomasov, an International Information Analyst at Detector Media. You will hear the first part of our conversation.</title>

      <title>This edition of International Dialogue is about the role of the cinema in times of war and how movies show the truth behind the frontline, as well as emotions in the hearts and minds of soldiers. The army is not for the weak people. People who serve need to have strong discipline and will. We know that the army plays a crucial role in Ukraine now. At the same time, culture and specifically movies, can reveal the truth through fiction, especially depicting situation behind the frontline. Maksym Nakonechnyi, a young Ukrainian director, has made a movie called «A Vision of Butterfly». So, the topic of Ukrainian soldiers, men or women, coming back from the front just started to arise. Creating a rehabilitation program for them is extremely important so they can find their place in society. Such movies as «A Vision of a Butterfly» clearly show that something needs to be done to help them. They need it. In terms of art – the movie is very well made as a fictional story of one girl who represents hundreds of thousands women like her, and the main actress did everything she could together with a director to make it believable. You will hear the second part of the conversation.</title>

Maksym Nakonechnyi, a young Ukrainian director, has made a movie called «A Vision of Butterfly». The main events occurred even before the full-scale invasion of Russian in Ukraine and focused on the air reconnaissance soldier Lilya. She returns from captivity and realizes that she is pregnant by the warden of the torture chamber, who raped her. But Lilya will not be a victim and has her own view on her fate. This movie caused different reactions. Some people expressed the opinion that it is too harmful to the current fragile psychology of Ukrainians. Some said it is totally up to the person to perceive this information. Maksym also triggered another interesting topic – the role of women in the Armed Forces.

      <title>This edition of International Dialogue is about different PSYOP and people Russia uses abroad to discredit Ukraine and how we can counter them. The guest in the studio was Dmytro Zolotukhin, an information security expert with over 15 years of experience and ex- deputy Minister of Information Policy. Such experts as Dmytro Zolotukhin clearly say that we need to have a strategy to counter Russia abroad and inside because inside conflicts of the country are not helping to win the war. Psychological warfare is a new tool of modern times. It becomes clear that those who control the media control people&#39;s minds. You will hear the second part of our conversation where we also talked about the importance of psychological health in Ukraine and dismissed public figures in Ukrainian government circle who created a danger for the general state image.</title>

      <title>This edition of International Dialogue is about different PSYOP and people Russia uses abroad to discredit Ukraine and how we can counter them. It is no news that the Russian propaganda machine is powerful abroad. The whole world is helping Ukraine in our hard times. At the same time, it is necessary to understand how to counter the Russian propaganda machine. For this, we need to figure out what PSYOP Russia is mainly using. This psychological weapon became the most powerful tool in the 21st century. People see news on the screen – then if they get caught in high emotion, usually hate or anger (if we are talking about Russians) – they immediately want to react, to express their feeling. There is also a lot of internet conflicts among Ukrainians in the media and abroad. People are fighting because of their different opinions. The right thing to do is to stay objective and give some time to yourself. Do not go immediately take a weapon in your hands and kill everyone. The guest in the studio was Dmytro Zolotukhin, an information security expert with over 15 years of experience and  ex-deputy minister of information policy of Ukraine. It is the first part of our conversation.</title>

      <title>This edition of International Dialogue is about the latest military support to Ukraine from Britain and the level the relations between our country and the United Kingdom. The UK has begun supplying Ukraine with long-range missiles, officials in London confirmed on May 11. The news represents a major milestone in international efforts to support the Ukrainian fightback against Russia’s ongoing invasion. Ukrainian leaders have been calling on international partners to provide long-range missiles for some time, arguing that such weapons are needed in order to complete the liberation of the country from Russian occupation. That goal now appears to be one step closer. The guest at the studio was Peter Dickinson, Publisher of Business Ukraine magazine. We will discuss the latest political developments in the United Kingdom and its military assistance to Ukraine. You will hear the first part of the conversation.</title>
