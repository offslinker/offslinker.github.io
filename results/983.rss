      <title>This edition of Ukraine Global is about unreliable business connections between Ukraine and Starlink. We must admit that the threat is all too real. The use of civilian equipment for military purposes is a serious problem in itself. Communication is a separate part of it. Russia&#39;s military tactics, which involve the destruction of means and communication channels, have left Ukrainians with no choice but to use available satellite channels. The fact that SpaceX can turn off Starlink services to any customer, country, or territory is a &quot;black box&quot; that costs Ukraine too much. However, the lack of an alternative has made Ukraine (and other countries where it is necessary to organize communication in difficult conditions) dependent on the imperfect but the only currently available tool — SpaceX&#39;s Starlink. The authors of The New York Times claim that Ukraine understands the excessive dependence on Starlink technologies and is looking for an alternative. Although Ukrainian officials have spoken with other satellite Internet providers, they have admitted that none of them can compete with Starlink. The monopoly position of SpaceX has become a real threat to Ukraine, which, unfortunately, cannot be overcome in the current conditions. It remains to be seen when the European alternative and the network of Amazon satellites will work.</title>

      <title>This edition of Ukraine Global is about the role of China as a mediator between Ukraine and Russia. China and Russia also have their own special relationship. Still, mindful of Russia´s long history of relentless expansion, eastwards as well as south and west, Chinese officials have seen reason to remind the Russians that Vladivostok was a Chinese city as recently as 1860. In the future it may become one of the reasons for their inner disagreements. However, China faces several fundamental obstacles to the success of its Russia- Ukraine strategy. First, since the war broke out last February, China has adopted a seemingly neutral position. But everyone knows that Beijing sides with Russia, and it has never condemned Russia for its aggression against Ukraine, or even called the invasion a war. Therefore, Ukraine and the democratic world at large must act quickly and decisively to put strategic limits on China’s role in the Russian-Ukrainian War.</title>

      <title>This edition of Ukraine Global raises the question how Russia is avoiding sanctions through cooperation with countries which didn’t support Ukraine and how can we improve this situation in Ukraine’s favor? The journalist of Ukrainian Radio, Viktoriya Kriukova talked with Iliya Kusa, an international policy expert who explained that Russia avoids Western sanctions through cooperation with the countries of BRICS union. We also discussed the possibility of political changes in Russia through opposition forces. If we talk about the G7 countries, they enjoy close relations among themselves, whereas China and India are old adversaries with unsettled territorial conflicts on their border. Furthermore, mindful of Russia´s long history of relentless expansion, eastwards as well as south and west, Chinese officials have seen reason to remind the Russians that Vladivostok was a Chinese city as recently as 1860. So, there is also a chance that inside quarrels between the countries of the BRICS union can help Ukraine to ruin Russia’s international alliances.</title>

      <title>This edition of Ukraine Global raises the question when the parliamentary elections in Ukraine will be held? Parliamentary elections in Ukraine should be on October 29, 2023. However, according to the provisions of Ukrainian legislation, it is prohibited to hold parliamentary or presidential elections during martial law. The main question is in the conditions under which elections to the Verkhovna Rada will be held in Ukraine and what role the de-occupied territories will play in this (and whether elections will be held there at all in the first years after liberation). So, how exactly the parliamentary elections will be held in Ukraine during wartime is still being determined. Still, the necessity of doing this is high because we have two Ukraines. One lives a more or less normal life, listening to the sirens, and the other is on the frontline. They want to know that they are fighting for the best future for their country. Holding parliamentary elections is a key element for building any democratic state. Still, it is extremely dangerous to do it in times of war because the enemy can use any opportunity to ruin the country inside.</title>

      <title>This edition is about the current state of the energy system in Ukraine a year after Russia’s targeted attacks on the country’s infrastructure and in the face of the upcoming winter. Ukrainian officials make no secret of their fear that, in terms of energy, the coming winter could be worse than last. According to Maksym Urakin, co-founder of Experts Club, in general, ahead of the autumn-winter season of 2023/2024, Ukraine’s power system is generally ready to provide stable electricity supply to consumers. Given the low intensity or absence of missile attacks on energy facilities, rolling blackouts may be sporadic or not applied at all. The probability of blackout in this scenario remains minimal. In the event of new attacks on the power system in the autumn and winter, the probability of blackouts increases, while the number and duration of blackouts will depend on the nature and success of attacks by the Russian Federation. At the same time, given the energy sector’s preparations for such a scenario, possible blackouts will be temporary.</title>

      <title>This edition of Ukraine Global is about the third summit of the Crimean Platform and its results. On 23 August, Kyiv hosted the third summit of the Crimean Platform. The main issues of the summit were the future of Crimea and the de-occupation of the peninsula by military means. This event was broadcast live on the YouTube channel of Crimean Platform. So, we can see that all democratic nations support Ukraine in our desire to return Crimea. Nevertheless, the peninsula&#39;s situation is quite hard regarding personal freedom for those who do not support Russia. Still, we need to understand that many people there, the post-Soviet generation, will support the dictatorship. The peninsula is split into two parts- pro-Russian and pro-democratic. First of all, we need to win the war, in general. And how it will happen, with returning Crimea immediately or later, only God knows.</title>

On June 20, 2022, the Ukrainian Parliament ratified the &quot;Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and combating violence against Women and domestic violence,&quot; known as the &quot;Istanbul Convention&quot;. On November 1, 2022, the Istanbul Convention came into force. Margarita Stavrova, a young lawyer from the United Kingdom, said that the situation is generally much better in Ukraine with gender equality. Still, there is so much to do in this field and the legal protection of women&#39;s rights, even in Arabic countries like the United Arab Emirates, is much stronger than in Ukraine.</title>

      <title>This edition of Ukraine Global is about the current Russian involvement into the war between the Israel and Hamas. The war between Palestina and Israel is not news for the world. It has been going on for decades with breaks. Many analysts said that Ukraine has to take an example from that situation, especially Israel, as a country at constant war. Now, the conflict blew up with a new power. Why did it happen now when Ukraine is so close to the winter season, and the USA stopped actively supplying weapons to our country because of the inner disagreements? It looks like, the devil Russian plan has started to work abroad now. So, for Ukraine, the situation looks not very good. Now, the world&#39;s attention has shifted to the Middle East, and it is hard to forecast who will win there. We can&#39;t do anything to help Israel in the global arena except evacuate Ukrainians from the dangerous area. The only hope is that the White House, whom we trust, has a strategy for dealing with this situation, continuing the military support to Ukraine. Now, the USA has to support both allies- Ukraine and Israel because of Russian intervention everywhere. They don&#39;t play by international rules and do what they want. It is a new type of diplomacy created by Mr. Putin. And we have to deal with it.</title>

      <title>This edition is about the concept of Intermarium geopolitical project and why it is beneficial for Ukraine to be a part of it. According to Hannes Nagel, head of the Center for Crisis Studies in Estonia, the consequences of the most recent wave of Russian aggression in Ukraine in 2022 will change the world in many aspects - from international law to nuclear security and locally from regional cooperation to integration. Jacek Bartosiak, a Polish lawyer and geopolitical expert commented on Intermarium and the future of Central and Eastern Europe in the context of the war in Ukraine. He also pointed out that Russia is trying to divide the countries of Intermarium alliance through diplomatic games and stressed that in case if Ukraine fails- they will be the next target. Ukraine&#39;s desire and request to be accepted and become part of a larger and real European security system (NATO) and economy (EU) identical to Estonia is still in the interests of all the parties mentioned above. Without achieving these strategic goals, we would remain an eternal periphery of Europe with associated threats and limitations. On a European scale, it would be a real geopolitical catastrophe of the 21st century – to be so close and simultaneously so far in the corner of the European waiting room.</title>

      <description>This edition is about the concept of Intermarium geopolitical project and why it is beneficial for Ukraine to be a part of it. According to Hannes Nagel, head of the Center for Crisis Studies in Estonia, the consequences of the most recent wave of Russian aggression in Ukraine in 2022 will change the world in many aspects - from international law to nuclear security and locally from regional cooperation to integration. Jacek Bartosiak, a Polish lawyer and geopolitical expert commented on Intermarium and the future of Central and Eastern Europe in the context of the war in Ukraine. He also pointed out that Russia is trying to divide the countries of Intermarium alliance through diplomatic games and stressed that in case if Ukraine fails- they will be the next target. Ukraine&#39;s desire and request to be accepted and become part of a larger and real European security system (NATO) and economy (EU) identical to Estonia is still in the interests of all the parties mentioned above. Without achieving these strategic goals, we would remain an eternal periphery of Europe with associated threats and limitations. On a European scale, it would be a real geopolitical catastrophe of the 21st century – to be so close and simultaneously so far in the corner of the European waiting room.</description>

      <title>This edition of Ukraine Global is about the total amount of military and financial help to Ukraine from the USA and how it can change after political instability in America. So, the total American military aid to our country is equal to $46.6 billion. US president Joe Biden admitted Wednesday he was worried that political turmoil in Washington could threaten US aid to Ukraine, urging Republicans to stop their infighting and back “critically important” assistance for Kyiv. Biden said that he would soon be giving a major speech on the need to support Ukraine’s fight against the Russian invasion after the chaos in Washington alarmed US allies. However, the magnitude of U.S. aid to Ukraine might seem less remarkable in comparison to what the Pentagon is budgeted each year, or what the Treasury was authorized (via the Troubled Asset Relief Fund) to bail out Wall Street banks, auto companies, and other sectors of the economy during the U.S. financial crisis. When compared with the critical support to Ukraine from other countries, the size of U.S. aid stands out. At the same time, some European governments, such as Norway, Latvia, and Estonia, are making far larger financial contributions to Ukraine relative to the size of their own economies. We hope that political turmoil’s will not stop the USA from helping democracy to win in Ukraine.</title>

      <title>This edition of Ukraine Global is about the young world and Ukrainian politicians who proved that sometimes it is not really necessary to have huge political experience behind your shoulders to become a country’s leader. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Justin Trudeau are just the most vivid examples of such leaders. The question is should people and companies give the chance those who don’t have any experience but have a strong desire and fire to work in their eyes. The answer is – yes and no. No, because those people are also more likely to crash and burn. Though the best leaders—Steve Jobs, Abraham Lincoln—were unfiltered, the things that made them so effective, such as their ability to think differently and not feel beholden to a certain way of doing things, often lead to terrible results. Unfiltered leaders are high risk, high reward. Filtered leaders—like Tim Cook and Neville Chamberlain—have deep knowledge and can be very effective in a stable situation. But they often can’t adapt to extreme, sudden change or are unable to disrupt the status quo, which an outsider feels freer to do. In Ukraine the situation is almost the same as in the whole world. People want new faces, smart, ambitious people who were not a part of an old political system. At the same time, creating contradiction because such people don’t understand how the system works inside. So, the possible variant is to be in the system, study it from aside and then create your own strategy of political growth.</title>

      <title>This edition of Ukraine Global is about the current state of events in the issue of the grain deal and how it is connected to the recent success of the Ukrainian military in the Black sea. The current situation with the grain deal remains unstable and unsure. Ukraine is interested in exporting its corn and wheat to the countries that need it the most. At the same time, it is really hard to do it during the war and Russian blockade of the Black Sea shipping routes.</title>

      <title>This edition of Ukraine: Global is about education in Ukraine in wartime and how students and teachers adapt to the new conditions in which they have to study. The entire system of education in Ukraine changed after Russia unleashed the full- scale war on February 24. Seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with all the restrictions it caused, Ukrainian schools, colleges and universities were hit by the devastating blow of the Russian invasion. Students and teachers alike, both those who stayed in the country and those who fled abroad, had to somehow adapt to the new conditions. Polina, Kira, Kristina, Misha, and Demyan have different stories, but they all have one desire – to live in a peaceful country. It&#39;s really hard to live, let alone study, in the conditions of war. Still, Ukrainian schools and universities have found ways to continue education. Of course, not without problems, but they still do it. For students, it&#39;s hard, first of all, psychologically, to study when the air raid alert sounds. They realize they are in danger. It’s hard for teachers to give online lessons when power supply and internet access are unstable and even unpredictable. And it’s difficult for principals to find the right way to balance online and offline education. Ukrainian students and teachers don&#39;t know how much longer this war will last, but they know that life will go on and that they must carry on.</title>

      <title>This edition of Ukraine: Global is about the situation regarding electricity outages in numerous Ukrainian cities due to the latest Russian missile attacks. How do Ukrainians deal with the hardships of electricity shortages, and what are the possible solutions to help resolve the situation? On Oct. 31, Russia launched a massive attack on Ukraine&#39;s energy system during Monday rush hour for the third time in the past month. Russia&#39;s aim – which its leadership publicly admits – is to hinder civilians&#39; access to electricity and heat, potentially inflicting a humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine. Iryna, Olga and Hanna shared their stories with RUI. Hennadiy Ryabtsev, a member of the Expert Council at the State Energy Efficiency Agency is sure that it&#39;s easy for Ukrainians to help energy workers - you must listen to their advice. It means the rational use of electrical appliances. Especially in the morning and evening, during the peak hours of consumption.</title>

      <title>This edition of Ukraine: Global is about a new package of financial, military, and diplomatic assistance to Ukraine from its Western partners, the Rammstein-5 meeting, and the latest success of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kharkiv region. Does this success owe to the recent deployment of US weapons to Ukraine? Is diplomacy helping Ukraine to speed up the battlefield success? The post-Cold War world order was totally destroyed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February, 2022. Diplomacy has always played a key role in building international relations between countries, but this time, it didn&#39;t help to stop the war unleashed by Russia. The previous week was very reach in diplomatic visits to Ukraine, which demonstrated its Western allies’ united desire to help it win the war. The deployment of Western weapons has already switched the balance in Ukraine’s favor. So, what is behind the visits by the Western high-ranking officials to our country? Hennadiy Maksak, the Foreign Policy Council &quot;Ukrainian Prism&quot; Executive Director, explains how the last financial and military package from the US could help to speed up Ukraine&#39;s victory?</title>
