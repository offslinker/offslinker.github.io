      <title>Oksana Moroz, a financial manager in a big IT company who, in the wake of the conflict in Ukraine, embarked on a journey across several Balkan countries. Oksana kindly agreed to tell about her time staying in the Balkan region and draw parallels and contrasts between the situation in past Yugoslavia and the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war. This was the 50th anniversary edition of the program &quot;With Ukraine in Heart&quot; about people of strong spirit who managed to find the strength to start life in other countries from scratch since the beginning of the war. These were stories of difficulties and small victories, these were stories of the incredible kindness of the locals who welcomed and helped our refugees in their countries, these were stories of the incredible flexibility, strength, and creativity of our people, which only confirms the statement once said by Sheikh Rashid: &quot;Hard times create strong people. Strong people create good times.&quot; So stay strong, and good times will definitely come.</title>

      <title>More than 12 thousand square kilometers of Ukraine&#39;s nature reserves have become a war zone. Populations of rare endemic and migrant species suffered great losses, birds were forced to abandon nests and change their usual migration routes. The efforts of decades-long conservation projects were ruined. According to claims by Ukraine&#39;s environment ministry, altogether the losses from land, water and air pollution amounted to $51.4 billion. Today, we have a very special guest with us, Mark Zheleznyak, who is living in Japan and working as a project professor at the Institute of Environment Radioactivity at Fukushima University.</title>

      <title>The reason you need art in wartime, wrote Jefferson, is because “history cannot exist without the discipline of imagination. ”Painting will not stop missiles.

      <title>There is still no safe place for children in Ukraine. Every war is a war against children. Right now 7.5 million children in Ukraine are in grave danger of physical harm, severe emotional distress, and displacement. The impact on civilians is reaching terrifying proportions. Today we have an interview with 13-year-old Kira Meshcherska who will tell us about war, through the eyes of a child. Children are exposed to situations of terror and horror during the war – experiences that may leave enduring impacts on post-traumatic stress disorder. Severe losses and disruptions in their lives lead to high rates of depression and anxiety in war-affected children.</title>

      <title>During wartime, theatrical performances and other forms of entertainment become increasingly important for people to distract themselves at least for an hour. Theatres also provide a means of raising funds and supplies for servicemen. Some of the money raised is used to buy equipment for soldiers at the front. As well theatres could often be used as shelters to rescue people during air alerts. Here is our talk with the director of ProEnglish Theatre - Alex Borovenskiy who is temporarily staying in Spain with a cultural mission. Theatrical performances provide temporary distraction and boosted morale. They remind us of life before the war and of those dearest to us. The importance of art is vital during wartime!</title>

Children’s camps play an important role in developing worthy members of society, intellectual, and active personalities. With the start of the war in our country, kids of Ukrainian refugees have the possibility to attend language camps that provide kids with educational activities, high standards of teaching English, and social initiatives. The idea of the Ukrainian camp is to form a new generation of lifelong learning creators, who are ready to change our country for the better! We are glad to introduce the camp owner of the language camp - Arcadia Cotruta. Part 2</title>
